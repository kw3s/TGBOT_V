So the reason I created this telegram bot was so I could seamlessly generate mp4 files whenever a user shared an image file and audio file (merges the 2 into one). Through the help of various APIs out there the bot would have 4 different modes:
1. The original mode or manual mode (user sends an image file plus an audio file)
2. Audio-only mode (the user would only send an audio file to the bot, and it would use its integrated APIs to fetch the respective cover/track/album art for said track. Pinpointing the correct track art might be challenging in this way so the user might have to specify the track details along with the audio file so the right track art is fetched)
3. Search mode and Link mode (the mode requiring the least effort by the user. They would just need to share the track details or a digital streaming platform (dsp) link (e.g. from Spotify, Deezer, Tidal or Apple music), and the bot would then have to utilise the provided info to grab both the audio and the track art and generate the mp4 file. Alright, we're done talking functionality.

User interface (on telegram):

1. Upon starting the bot for the first time, it should display buttons for the 3 modes (ones that the user can interact with to select their preferred mode)
2. Animations. I understand the bot won't immediately spit out the mp4 file once the user sends what's needed, so for each step of the process, the bot must let the user know what is currently going on or being done, and simple entertaining animations should be displayed-- preferably at every step of the process that requires waiting.

That's pretty much it.
It's a bot for music lovers. I intend for it to be seamless, lightweight, and not choppy.

I'm not sure if you're capable of finding some good and appropriate/necessary APIs that would help get the jobs done, so if you aren't just let me know and I'll share a bunch.
