Comprehensive feedback post ARL integration for bot's link mode (aka Link mode testing session 3).

Links tried during session: Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, Apple Music and Amazon Music.

Note for Claude: When I say logs in the feedback I'm referring to the logs_result.json or Logs.txt files in workspace.

2/6 videos were successfully generated by bot (we can only say one of the bot's modes is stable once it can successfully generate at least 5 videos consecutively, thus, link mode is currently not stable).

The 2 successfully generated videos were:
1st (Tidal link) and 2nd (Amazon music link).


The four failures were:
Spotify (2 links), Deezer (ironic) and Apple Music.


Details

1. First video that was successfully generated was generated from a successfully processed Tidal link sent by the user; event was executed with zero errors (check logs for God Made A Way)

2. Second successfully generated video was initially an Amazon music link the user sent; no search results yielded post link processing so bot went on to ask me to text the track details, after which the audio was successfully fetched and the video was generated (check logs for Put It On God, Limoblaze)

3. The first failure was an Apple Music link; link processing seemed to have gone well but the wrong track was fetched or searched (check logs for At The Cross, Trip Lee)

4. Second failure was, ironically, a deezer link; bot said no matching tracks were found so it went on to ask me for track info via text, after which it matched an incorrect track (I do not understand how and why; this happened right after I cancelled the operation in chat, using /cancel command) (check logs for Worthless De la cruz)

5. Third failure was a Spotify link; the event seemed to have grabbed the right audio but encountered an error during the merging process (an error I'm no stranger to, me and Gemini 3 been battling it since a couple of updates ago); not so sure what went wrong (check logs for JAMES DEAN)

6. Fourth failure was another Spotify link; bot said no match was found so it asked me to text track info, and it still didn't find a match after I did, then it asked me to text track info AGAIN (what? that's not supposed to happen, 2 times the charm?😭); I ended up cancelling the request.


IMPORTANT NOTICE for Claude: I already requested an improvement concerning search formatting in one of the previous patches with Gemini 3. In the case of dsp link (Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, Apple Music and Amazon Music) handling, the link provided to the bot by the user is NOT to be fed directly into yt-dlp or deemix; the link is to be used as a source of info on the track (specifically Track name and Artist name). Track and Artist names are to be obtained from the text of the shared link (I call this link processing).
NO FEEDING of the actual link to yt-dlp or deemix should occur, ever.


Format of the track info obtained from link (to be used for search process) must be:

Track name Artist name

No hyphens, just spaces

The Logic: Once link processing has taken place the bot can utilise the same code structure or logic as when the user texts track info (this is the core of link mode, it is 2 modes in one link or text input from user).


I noticed from the logs (I'm the one that compiled the Logs.txt file) that some link processing events yielded more than just Track name and Artist name, which is a possible cause of some of the errors that occurred, especially with the Spotify links.

Note: Since I'm the one that was handling the logs txt file you might run into some repeated texts, may have pasted some info more than once.


Concerning the message the bot sends the user when a match isn't found ("❌ No matching results found on any source (Deezer, SoundCloud, YouTube, Archive).

💡 Tip: Try typing the 'Track Name Artist' manually."), let's change that to like just a "No match found💔"
The tip can stay.

I've also noticed that some text the bot sends has a bunch of asterisks in it, let's fix that. It's not good for the UX.

Alright, I'm done.
